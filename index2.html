# Docker 201

# Introduction

Self: 
- Manish Raj <manish_raj@outlook.com>
- Tech: techramblings.bitbucket.io
- Fun: instagram.com/geek.manish 

Session:
- Introduction to docker - intermediate
- Not hands-on
- Verbose, focusing on Docker CE
- Interactive

# Agenda

1. Virtualization vs Containerization
2. Why use docker
3. Docker basics
4. Running a docker container
5. Building a docker image
6. Publishing your docker image
7. Common docker operations
8. Questions
9. Something to explore

---

# Containerization

- OS level virtualization
- Single kernal instance
- Control groups + namespaces = multiple isolated user spaces
- COW union file system: AUFS

#### Virtualization vs Containerization

# Why use docker

- The usual benefits:
      - portable, run on any docker host
      - built-in version tracking: 
        build and commit have unique commit hashes
      - re-usable components: images, layers
      - public registry with tons of free-to-use images

- More benefits:
      - Strictly reproducible environments:
          - helps with running integration tests in exact env as prod
          - helps with debugging, setting up local dev envs quickly
      - Speed and performance compared to virtual machines
      - Ability to create multi-tier docker applications
      - Scalable, rapid deployments used: swarm, compose, kubernetes
      - Set memory, resource constraints, limit capabilities like IPC

---

# Docker basics

- Basic terminology
  - Docker host: computer on which docker is running

  - Docker daemon + Docker CLI: 
      - Client server architecture
      - Don't need to be on same machine
      - Client issues commands
      - Daemon servers those commands
      - Rest API at unix:///var/run/docker.sock (https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.24/)
      - This is how docker works on Windows and MacOS

---

### Docker CLI + Docker Daemon

## Docker basics (contd.)

  - Image: 
    - Snapshot or blueprint
    - Composed of layers
    - Parent layers are shared, reduces disk usage
    - Once image is built - layers of the image are immutable
    - Images can have tag
    - Images can be pulled and pushed

  - Container: 
      - Instance of docker image
      - Can be started, stopped, terminated and committed
      - Multiple docker-containers can be linked to create a tiered docker architecture

---

## Docker basics (contd.)
    - Volumes:
        - Share branches of host filesystem with running container
        - COW
  
    - Dockerfile: set of instructions to build an image
    - Docker Repository: a host for docker images
    - Docker registry: host for docker repo where images can be pushed and pulled from
    - Docker compose: A tool to orchestration creation and lifecycle of multiple docker containers

---

# Running a docker container

Run a hello-world container:

`docker run hello-world`

### With more options:

Run Jenkins:

`docker run --name jenkins --restart always -d -p 9999:8080 jenkins/jenkins:lts-alpine`

Discuss:
 - Options, repo
 - Ease of running something like Jenkins

---

# Building a docker image

Dockerfile

```
FROM alpine:3.1

# Update

RUN apk add --update nodejs

# Install app dependencies

COPY package.json /src/package.json

RUN cd /src; npm install

# Bundle app source

COPY . /src

EXPOSE  8080

CMD ["node", "/src/index.js"]
```

---

### Building a docker image (contd.)

1. `docker build -t nodeapp:v1 .`
2. `docker build -t nodeapp:latest .`
3. `docker build -t nodeapp .`

And run:

1. `docker run nodeapp:v1`
2. `docker run nodeapp:latest`
3. `docker run nodeapp`

### Run with ports exposed:

`docker run -p 8080:8080 nodeapp`

---

# Publishing your docker image

- Default docker registry is at https://hub.docker.com:
- Signup if not already.

1. `docker login`
2. `docker tag nodeapp rajmanish/sample-nodeapp:v1`
3. `docker push rajmanish/sample-nodeapp:v1`

Some notes:

- Tags are optional
- Default tag is "latest" for both pull and push operations
- A docker repository on hub.docker.com can be public or private
- Public images are accessible to everyone
- Only one private repo for free users
- For CI/CD or storing nightly docker image builds, you can run own registry instead of using the docker-hub registry

---

# Common docker operations

- docker ps: list containers
- docker logs: get container logs
- docker inspect: inspect container/resources
- docker exec: run command within a container
- docker attach: attach to running container
- docker kill: kill a container
- docker pause: pause a container
- docker port: show ports allocated to a container
- docker top: show top processes running in a container
- docker commit: create image from a running container
- docker save|load: save|load image to a tar file
- docker search: search for registry
- docker volume create: create a volume

## Common docker operations (contd.)

### Networking in docker:

- Modes: 
    - bridge (default)
    - host
    - none

---

## Common docker operations (contd.)

### Docker compose

Possibilities:

- Orchestrate multi-container docker applications
- YAML driven way of doing what you can achieve with docker-CLI and some bash scripts
- More organized and preferred for multi-container docker setups
- You do not always need a docker-compose file
- Current compose spec v3: https://devhints.io/docker-compose

Commands:

1. `docker-compose start|stop`
2. `docker-compose pause|unpause`
3. `docker-compose ps`
4. `docker-compose up|down` - re-creates containers

# Questions?

---

## Something to explore:

- Docker networking
- Docker volume
- Docker-compose YAML spec
- Setting constraints on docker containers

## Thank you
